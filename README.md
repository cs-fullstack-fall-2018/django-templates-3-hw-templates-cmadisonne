WRITE YOUR 3 ANSWERS BELOW

I learned the following: 
- A variable looks like {{ variable }} in the template. 
- Filters are used to modify variables.
- {% Tags %} can creat text or allow functionality. I guess it's kind of like <script></script>
- Template Inheritance is the skeleton template, and children templates can overide certain blocks to make certain changes.
